### Question 1
Determine the validity of an input string `s`, which consists solely of the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]`. You need to check the following conditions:

The opening brackets:

- Must match with the corresponding closing brackets of the same type

- Must be closed in the correct order

- Should have a corresponding opening bracket of the same type.


    Example:

        Input: s = "()"
        Output: true



### Question 2
There are n people in a line waiting to purchase tickets, with the 0th person at the front and the (n - 1)th person at the back.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array of tickets of length n, where tickets[i] represents the number of tickets that the i-th person wishes to purchase.

Each person purchases a ticket in exactly one second. A person can only purchase one ticket at a time and must return to the end of the line (which happens instantly) to purchase additional tickets. If a person has no more tickets to buy, he or she will leave the line.

Return the time spent for the individual atâ€¯position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.

    Example:

        Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
        Output: 6



### Question 3
You are given an array `heights` representing the heights of students in a class. The students are standing in a line, and their heights are listed in the order they appear from left to right. The school wants to arrange the students in a non-decreasing order by their heights. However, when they rearrange the students, a few may end up in different positions from their original positions.

You need to write a function `heightChecker(heights)` that determines the minimum number of students who are not standing in the correct positions after the rearrangement. Implement the function `heightChecker` and return the minimum number of students who are not positioned correctly.

    Example:

        Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
        Output: 3



### Question 4
You are given a deck of integer arrays. There is a deck of cards with each card having a unique integer, and the integer on the ith card is deck[i].

You can arrange the deck in any order; all cards in one deck are initially face-down (unrevealed).

Repeat the following steps until all cards are revealed.

Step 1: Take out the top card from the deck and reveal it.

Step 2: If there are still cards in the deck, you should place the next top card at the bottom of the deck.

Step 3: If any cards remain unseen, return to step 1. Otherwise, proceed to the end.

Step 4: Return a deck order that reveals the cards in increasing order.

    Example:

        Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
        Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
